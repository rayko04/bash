# 📁 mcd — Make and Change Directory in One Go

`mcd` is a simple Bash function that combines `mkdir` and `cd` into a single command. It creates a directory (if it doesn't exist) and instantly navigates into it.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Creates a new directory, including parent folders (`mkdir -p`)
- Automatically changes into that directory (`cd`)
