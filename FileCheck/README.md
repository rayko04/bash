# FileCheck â€” Simple File Permission Checker (Bash)

`FileCheck` is a lightweight Bash function that checks whether a given file exists and whether it is readable and/or writable. It's ideal for quick permission checks during scripting or system maintenance.

## What It Does

Given a file name, it tells you:

- Whether the file exists
- Whether it's readable, writable, or both
- Gives clear messages for missing or inaccessible files
