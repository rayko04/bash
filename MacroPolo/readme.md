# 📌 MacroPolo — Save and Jump to Directory in Bash

`MacroPolo` is a simple Bash utility that lets you save your current directory and jump back to it later — like setting a bookmark for your terminal session.

## 🧠 What It Does

- `macro` → Saves the **current working directory** to a variable
- `polo`  → Returns you to the saved directory

Think of it like saying:

> Macro! (🗣️ Save my spot)  
> Polo!  (📍Jump back to it)
