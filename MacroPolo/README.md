# MacroPolo — Save and Jump to Directory in Bash

`MacroPolo` is a simple Bash utility that lets you save your current directory and jump back to it later — like setting a bookmark for your terminal session.

## What It Does

- `macro` → Saves the **current working directory** to a variable
- `polo`  → Returns you to the saved directory
